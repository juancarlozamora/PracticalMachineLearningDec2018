## Introduction  
Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. 

These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it.  

In this project, we will use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants to predict the manner in which they did the exercise.

The training data for this project are available here:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv

The test data are available here:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv

The data for this project come from this source: http://web.archive.org/web/20161224072740/http:/groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har. If you use the document you create for this class for any purpose please cite them as they have been very generous in allowing their data to be used for this kind of assignment.

## Data Preprocessing  
**If you don't have these packages it, install it**

```{r, cache = T}
library(caret)
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
library(randomForest)
library(corrplot)
library(ggplot2)
```
### Download the Data
Donload the data from the links provided
```{r, cache = T}
trainUrl <-"https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv"
testUrl <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv"
trainFile <- "./data/pml-training.csv"
testFile  <- "./data/pml-testing.csv"
if (!file.exists("./data")) {
  dir.create("./data")
}
if (!file.exists(trainFile)) {
  download.file(trainUrl, destfile=trainFile, method="curl")
}
if (!file.exists(testFile)) {
  download.file(testUrl, destfile=testFile, method="curl")
}
```  
### Read the Data
After downloading the data from the data source, we can read the two csv files into two data frames.  
```{r, cache = T}
trainRaw <- read.csv("./data/pml-training.csv")
testRaw <- read.csv("./data/pml-testing.csv")
dim(trainRaw)
dim(testRaw)
```
The training data set has 19622 observations and 160 variables
The testing data set has 20 observations and 160 variables.
The "classe" variable in the training set is the outcome to predict. 

### Clean the data
1.Clean the data and get rid of observations with missing values
2.Also remove irelevant variables
```{r, cache = T}
sum(complete.cases(trainRaw))
```
This step removes columns that contain NA missing values.
```{r, cache = T}
trainRaw <- trainRaw[, colSums(is.na(trainRaw)) == 0] 
testRaw <- testRaw[, colSums(is.na(testRaw)) == 0] 
```  
This step removes some columns that do not contribute much to the accelerometer measurements.
```{r, cache = T}
classe <- trainRaw$classe
trainRemove <- grepl("^X|timestamp|window", names(trainRaw))
trainRaw <- trainRaw[, !trainRemove]
trainCleaned <- trainRaw[, sapply(trainRaw, is.numeric)]
trainCleaned$classe <- classe
testRemove <- grepl("^X|timestamp|window", names(testRaw))
testRaw <- testRaw[, !testRemove]
testCleaned <- testRaw[, sapply(testRaw, is.numeric)]
```
Currently, the cleaned training data set has 19622 observations and 53 variables.
Currently, the testing data set has 20 observations and 53 variables.
The "classe" variable is still in the cleaned training set.

### Slice the data
This step cleans the training set into a pure training data set (70%) and a validation data set (30%). 
Use the validation data set to conduct cross validation in upcoming steps.
```{r, cache = T}
set.seed(22519) # For reproducibile purpose
inTrain <- createDataPartition(trainCleaned$classe, p=0.70, list=F)
trainData <- trainCleaned[inTrain, ]
testData <- trainCleaned[-inTrain, ]
```

## Data Modeling
Fit a predictive model for activity recognition using Random Forest algorithm because it automatically selects important variables.
Use 5-fold cross validation when applying the algorithm.  
```{r, cache = T}
controlRf <- trainControl(method="cv", 5)
modelRf <- train(classe ~ ., data=trainData, method="rf", trControl=controlRf, ntree=250)
modelRf
```
Estimate the performance of the model on the validation data set.  
```{r, cache = T}
predictRf <- predict(modelRf, testData)
confusionMatrix(testData$classe, predictRf)
```
```{r, cache = T}
accuracy <- postResample(predictRf, testData$classe)
accuracy
oose <- 1 - as.numeric(confusionMatrix(testData$classe, predictRf)$overall[1])
oose
```
**Result*** - The estimated accuracy of the model is 99.42% and the estimated out-of-sample error is 0.58%.

## Predicting for Test Data Set
Apply the model to the original testing data set downloaded from the data source. We remove the `problem_id` column first.  
```{r, cache = T}
result <- predict(modelRf, testCleaned[, -length(names(testCleaned))])
result
```
